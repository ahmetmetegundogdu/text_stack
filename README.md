Data Structures Practice Project

This project was developed for a **Data Structures** course to demonstrate the use of **Stacks** and **Queues**.

Features
- Text editor simulation** using two stacks (`undo` / `redo`)
- Supports basic operations:
  - write
  - undo
  - redo
  - show
- Command processor implemented with a custom queue
- Commands are executed sequentially to produce the final text

Concepts Used
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)
- Custom data structure implementations

Purpose
To apply theoretical data structure concepts in a practical and understandable way.
