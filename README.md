# text_stack
This project was developed as part of a data structures course assignment

Review the program in LISTING 4.1 in Chapter 4 of the textbook (pages 120-121) and read the relevant sections. Using the code as a reference, write your own String Stack class named TextStack. Create two objects from this class and write the code to perform the following operations (Those who wish can make it more interactive by allowing text input via a TextBox, performing Undo and Redo with buttons, and displaying the entire text in a RichTextBox, etc.): 

Objective
Implement a simple text editor that supports undo and redo operations using stacks.
Description
•	Two stacks: undoStack and redoStack

•	Commands:
o	write <text> – append text
o	undo – undo last write
o	redo – redo undone action
o	show – display current text */
b) Review the queue program (138-140) in LISTING 4.4 in Chapter 4 of the textbook, and read the relevant sections. Using the code as a reference, write your own String Queue class named CommandQ. When given a string such as “w Data w MINING u w Structures s”, parse each command, assign it to the queue object you will generate from the CommandQ class, then parse the commands from the queue and print “Data Structures” for this example. [w: write, u:undo …]
